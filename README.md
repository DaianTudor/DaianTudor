## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tudor and I am a Secondary School student from Romania. I am interested in Mathematics, Computer Science, Cybersecurity and whatnot. I also participated in the 75th Romanian National Mathematical Olympiad, 75th Romanian National Olympiad in Informatics and many more contests.

Wait. Where's that recommendation? I guess we'll never know.
