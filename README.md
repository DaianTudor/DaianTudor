## Hi there, I'm Tudor 👋

I am a 9th grade student at the "Tudor Vianu" National High School of Computer Science (specialising in Mathematics-Informatics, Intensive Informatics). I am interested in Competitive Mathematics, CTFs, Physics (sometimes) and whatnot.

I play for the `vianu_hack` team in most CTFs, however, you will also find me playing under the teams `H@ck-the-Code` and `Sheesh Sheba`. Also, I wrote two CTF challenges for the VianuCTF 2026 competition (crypto + misc/stegano).
