## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tudor and I am a Secondary School student from Romania. I am interested in Olympiad Mathematics, Competitive Programming, Cybersecurity and whatnot.

I have been the administrator of my school's Department of Mathematics website, https://e-mate.ro for 3 years (this is my last year taking "care" of it) and I am part of the PNCB Informatics team.

Recommmendation :
Wait. Where's that recommendation? I guess we'll never know.
